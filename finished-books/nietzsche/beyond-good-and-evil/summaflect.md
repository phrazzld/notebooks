What a creature this book is!

Nietzsche speaks with a reckless contempt that reminds me of Taleb; I wonder how much Taleb was encouraged by Nietzsche, and when.

I like the Translator's Preface by Kaufmann because it sheds some light on the failings of the translators that came before--mainly, neither of the two previous translators had been philosophers.

## On the Prejudices of Philosophers

Nietzsche demonstrates tremendous understanding of the history of philosophy, and of the weaknesses of the most popular philosophies that have come before. But the first thing Nietzsche does is challenge the "will to truth", not so much its desirability but its identity. What if the truth that we have been willing ourselves towards for so many generations, what if the all of the philosophic labor spent on these questions has not been advancing us towards Truth at all?

> The will to truth which will still tempt us to many a venture, that famous truthfulness of which all philosophers so far have spoken with respect &mdash; what questions has this will to truth not laid before us! What strange, wicked, questionable questions! That is a long story even now &mdash; and yet it seems as if it had scarcely begun. Is it any wonder that we should finally become suspicious, lose patience, and turn away impatiently? that we should finally learn from this Sphinx to ask questions, too? _Who_ is it really that puts questions to us here? _What_ in us really wants "truth"?

He characterizes our will to truth as a Sphinx that poses us, not idle or benign, but compelling and _wicked_ questions that _still tempt us to many a venture_. What is good? Do I matter? Why am I here? For thousands of years we grappled with the questions this Sphinx posed us, never stopping to question the Sphinx and its motives and misunderstandings, never stopping to ask who the Sphinx really is and what it really wants of us.

Philosophers used to be charged with codifying Universal Truth, and now they're just mouthpieces for the Lizard-Man Survival Warlord; the questions they think relevant to investigate were selected by evolutionary pressure to sustain the particular creature we are and in no other way bear any relationship to Objective Reality as we like to imagine it; the information philosophers use to assign strength to conflicting arguments is defined by this same evolutionary selection pressure and thus holds the same tenuous relationship with Objective Reality.

Calls basically everyone a propagandist:

> They [philosophers] all pose as if they had discovered and reached their real opinions through the self-development of a cold, pure, divinely unconcerned dialectic (as opposed to the mystics of every rank, who are more honest and doltish &mdash; and talk of "inspiration"); while at bottom it is an assumption, a hunch, indeed a kind of "inspiration" &mdash; most often a desire of the heart that has been filtered and made abstract &mdash; that they defend with reasons they have sought after the fact.

Nietzsche consistently makes his arguments from genealogical grounds, claiming that the "will to truth" or the "drive to knowledge" or whatever previous generations of philosophers called this phenomenon was not actually paramount in the human spirit.

> I do not believe that a "drive to knowledge" is the father of philosophy; but rather that another drive has, here as elsewhere, employed understanding (and misunderstanding) as a mere instrument.
