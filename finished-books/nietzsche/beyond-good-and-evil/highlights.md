> ... on September 22, 1886, he [Nietzsche] wrote Jacob Burckhardt: "Please read this book (although it says the same things as my _Zarathustra_, but differently, very differently--)."

> This is one of the great books of the nineteenth century, indeed of any century, despite much with which the modern reader might disagree. There is much in it with which I too do not agree; but that is also true of Plato's and Aristotle's writings, of all great philosophical works and, making due allowances for the different genre, of Dante's and Dostoevsky's ideas and of the Bible. There are some passages that strike me as blemishes without which the book would be better; for example; the tedious remarks about women, the mercifully briefer comments on the English, and the poem at the end.

> The will to truth which will still tempt us to many a venture, that famous truthfulness of which all philosophers so far have spoken with respect--what questions has this will to truth not laid before us! What strange, wicked, questionable questions! That is a long story even now--and yet it seems as if it had scarcely begun. Is it any wonder that we should finally become suspicious, lose patience, and turn away impatiently? that we should finally learn from this Sphinx to ask questions, too? _Who_ is it really that puts questions to us here? _What_ in us really wants "truth"?
